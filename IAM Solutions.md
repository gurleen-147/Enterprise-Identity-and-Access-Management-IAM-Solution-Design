##  IAM Solution Designs

### User Lifecycle Management

**🎯 Objective:**  
To optimize and automate user onboarding, access modifications, and offboarding processes.

**Solution:**  
- Implement an **automated user provisioning system** integrated with the HR database.  
- Ensure **real-time updates** to user access permissions based on employment status.  
- Provide a **self-service portal** for employees to request access changes, routed through **manager approval workflows**.

**Technology:**  
- Use **SailPoint** for automated provisioning and de-provisioning.  
- Integrate with HR systems via **API connectors** for accurate and synchronized user data.




###  Access Control Mechanisms

**🎯 Objective:**  
To strengthen access controls and minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

**Solution:**  
- Implement a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system with roles defined by job responsibilities.  
- Conduct **regular access reviews and certifications** to ensure alignment with roles.

**Technology:**  
- Use **Oracle Identity Manager** for role-based permission assignment.  
- Integrate with **Active Directory** for centralized management and authentication.
